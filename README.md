This repository contains the MATLAB source code of the DECC-MDG algorithm for solving the CEC'2010 and CEC'2013 benchmark suites.

#### DECC-MDG
* MergedDifferentialGrouping : This directory contains all the necessary files for running the merged differential  gropuing algorithm for the CEC'2010 and CEC'2013 benchmark suites.
>run2010: the entry point for running the MDG algorithm on the CEC'2010 benchmark functions.  
>run2013: the entry point for running the MDG algorithm on the CEC'2010 benchmark functions.  
>results2010: The grouping results of the MDG algorithm on the CEC'2010 benchmark function.  
>results2013: The grouping results of the MDG algorithm on the CEC'2013 benchmark function.  

* run2010: Embed the MDG algorithm grouping results into the DECC framework, and optimize the CEC'2010 benchmark suite.
* run2013: Embed the MDG algorithm grouping results into the DECC framework, and optimize the CEC'2013 benchmark suite.
